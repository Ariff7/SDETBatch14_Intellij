Maps in Java:
   -Maps are datastructures that allow us to store key value pairs

 Why should we use Maps?
    -Wgenever we have to store key value pairs instead of using arrays or 2D arrays or ArrayList we should use Maps because
    they provide very good performance and have built-in methods to process the data

 What is the syntax pf Maps?
    Map<DataTypeOfKey, DataTypeOfValue> anyName=new Mapclass<>():
 ex: HashMap<String, Double> friuts=new HashMap<>():

 Types of Maps : (over 300)
   1.)HashMap - mostly wide used,  fastest, no duplicates , prints in no order, occupies less memory
               -always use HashMap if there are no requirements for insertion or sorting

   2.)LinkedHashMap --keeps the insertion order but takes a little bit more memory then HashMap and is a little slower


   3.)TreeMap   -- sorts the data in natural order(a-z)(0-9) but insertion is very slow , it takes more memory to keep
                  the data in sorted order


FileHandling:
    Reading writing data to files with the help of java is called file handling.
Steps to read data from any files on any computer:
    1)location of file on our computer.
    2) we need to go to that location.
    3) we need a software that can read and write data to that file for exmaple we need Microsoft Excel if we
    want to work with xlsx files.
