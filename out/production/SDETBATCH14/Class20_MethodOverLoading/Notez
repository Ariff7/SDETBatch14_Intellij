MethodOverLoading:
        -allows us to create multiple methods in a class with the same name.
           -with different parameters

Why should we create multiple methods with same name??
        -gives the End User flexibility
        -End user can call the same method with different parameters to get same or different results

How do we overload a method??
      1st way-- by passing different number of parameters.
      2nd way-- by changing the data type
      3rd way-- changing the sequence (order) of parameters

Syntax to overload a method?
