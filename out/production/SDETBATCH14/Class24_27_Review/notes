Collection FrameWork-
      -a set of classes and interfaces that help us store and manipulate data.

Why we need collections framework
  1.)Flexibility
  2.) Ready-made Methods
  3.) Same classes and methods ccan be used with different  dataType

 Some common classes -
  1.)ArrayList
  2.)LinkedList

  3.)HashSet - not in order
  4.)LinkedHashSet - insertion order
  5.)TreeSet

common Interfaces
    1.)List  - List like ArrayList and LinkedList maintains the insertion order
             -they allow duplicates

    2.)Set  - They Do not allow duplicate values

    ArrayList vs LinkedList
      ArrayList -- When we need to retrieve the data ( get())because it is very fast to retrieve index based data as underlying datastructures is an array
                -- Store data in consecutive order

      LinkedList -- When we need to we manipulate the data (Adding, removing shifting) ( add(), remove() ,


  HashSet vs LinkedHastSet vs TreeSet:

        HashSet-it the fastest and it requires less memory but not in order
        LinkedHashSet - it is in order but not as fast
        TreeSet- Natural order (Ex: Phonebook,Dictionary)  basically A-Z , 0- infinity)

//NOT APART OF COLLECTION FRAMEWORK
Maps-- Whenever we have to storey key value pairs (Ex: Items and prices) we should use Maps

3 types of Maps

       HashMap: does not retain order, but it is the fastest
       LinkedHashMap: It retains the order but it is a little slower than Hash
       TreeMap : Sort the data chrnoglgical but it is the slowest
