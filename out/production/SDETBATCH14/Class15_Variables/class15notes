Types of variables with respect to their scope:

 3 Types of variables ^

  1.) Local Variables - a variable that is created inside a method, loop, switch cases,if,etc (inside a block of code)
                                                                                        {}
       Up-side of local variables :

                  -less time in the memory
                  -exist for a very short amount of time in the memory

       Down-Side of local variables :

                   -does not work outside of {}
                   -scope is very limited


  2.) Instance Variables - a variable that is declared inside a class but outside of block of code
                          - need objects

         Up-Side of Instance variables

                    -can use Instance variable inside any block of code that is inside that class

         Down-side of Instance variables

                    -occupy the memory for longer than a LOCAL variable

            WHEN TO USE? --- when we need to share a value between  2 or more methods
                         --- planning to create multiple objects of a class, and it is possible that all the objects
                            can have a different value for that variable

  3.) Static Variables - an instance variable with STATIC keyword

        Up-Side of Static variables

                   - we cab share data across the objects with the help of static variable

         Downside of Static variable

                   -they occupy the memory for the longest period

         WHEN TO USE--- when we want to share something across all the methods
