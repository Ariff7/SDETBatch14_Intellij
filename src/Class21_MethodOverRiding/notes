Method OverRiding -  ALLOWS us to have same name methods in parent and child classes with its own implemention

Why should we OverRide a method

            -Lets say we are inherriteting from a Parent class that has 10 methods. WE like(need) 8 of them,  (EXCEPT PRIVATE methods and constructors)
            and want to reuse those methods but don't need the other 2, we want to provide implementation in a different way
                                                       ^^^
                                              We can use method overRiding those methods
            -also helps us achieve polymorphism

What is Syntax to override a method:

                  1.)First there must be a parent-child relationship
                  2.) we simply redefine the method in the child class
