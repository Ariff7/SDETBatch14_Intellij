Exceptions:
 - It is an  unwanted behavior that occurs at run time(during excuetion) and disturbs the normal flow of a program

Why should we learn?Important?
 1.)- When we are building applications(Web Apps) for other users like google,discord,zoom, etc. we can use exception handling
 to improve the user experience when we handle exception applications no longer terminate abruptly.
 2.)- Convert complex system generated messages error messages to something that everyone can understand
 3.) (Most important) - We can use expections to figure out the exact line of code and also get an explanation about that error

 What is the Syntax:

Keywords: try/catch/finally/throw/throws

 we can handle exceptions using try catch block -{}
 we can also utilize finally block and we use new keywords like throw and throws

 Try-catch block :
        try{
         //put code in here that might cause some problems / we are not sure about
        } catch(name of the class whos exception we are expecting (ex:  IndexOutOfBoundsException e ){
         //Backup code or the code that we want to execute incase the code in try block fails
        } finally  {
          //the code that we want to execute no matter what happens in try or catch blocl
          // ex:
        }

Throw keyword:
  We use to throw keyword to through the exception

Throws:
  When we want to avoid writing a try/catch block we can use the throws keyword with method header to throw this responsibility
  to the calller of the method. It is bad but we should avoid it if we know how to handle an exception
