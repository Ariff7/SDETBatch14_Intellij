ArrayList vs LinkedList:
  Both implement the list interface. BUT internal implementation is different.

arrayList - faster in storing and acccess data( when we use get method)
linkedList - faster in manipulation of data(Adding new data at run time in-between or in the start of the list or removing data)of data.

Sets -- Sets are a set of dataStructures in collections framework that allow us to store only unique data.
        when we have to remove any duplicate daa from Lists

  HashSet-
           Upside: It is most memory efficient and requires less space as compared to other types of Sets
           Downside: does not maintain the insertion order

  LinkestHashSet -
         Upside: order of the elements is maintained
         Downside: takes more memory and it is slower than HashSet

   TreeSet-
         Upside:  sorts the elements in Chronoligcal order or from smallest to largest for numbers (Natural Order- ascii table)
         Downside: The slowest of all sets and takes more memory than all.

Important interview question:
What is toString() method?
toString method is used to print instance fields of a class whenever we try to print the object of a class println
method internally calls this method. This method is inherited from the Object class. All the casses that we create
in java automatically inherited from Object class.
