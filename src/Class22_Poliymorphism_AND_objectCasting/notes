Type Casting in objects:
       -Storing the object of a child class in a variable of parent type

 WHY SHOULD WE CAST OBJECTS??
       -we can start storing the objects of child classes in an array of type parent

 Syntax for type casting in objects
         -same as primitive type casting
         -ex -animal class and if animal class has a child class Cat, we can do
                                                                        Animal animal=new Cat();
                                                                        parent name[] arr={new childclass name}

Polymorphism : the abililty of a method to take oon many forms based on the objects or the parameters that we pass to the method
              -polymorphism in Java allows us to perform the same action in many different ways.

2 types of Polymorphism-

         1.)Compile time/static/early binding
             -WHEN WE USE METHOD overloading to acheive polymorphism
         2.)run time/dynamic/late binding
              -WHEN WE USE METHOD OVERRIDING to acheive polymorpshism
