Final keyword : jsut like any other keyword in java like (class, package, void,etc);

3 main uses of final keyword-

       1.) if we use final keyword in a class, no other class can inherit from that class.
       2.) If we use final keyword with a method name, no child class can override that method
       3.)If we use final keyword in a field, once a value has been assigned to that field, no one can change its values afterward
            (ex: Int price=20;)
