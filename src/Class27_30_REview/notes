HashTable:
   HashTable is previous version of HashMap. HashTable is thread safe. It uses synchronization to achieve
   thread sadety and because of this it is slow as compared to hashMap.

Why should we NOT use HashTable.
   As a tester it is very rare that we will be writing multithreaded code and if don't write multithreaded
   code but still use HashTable it will make our code slow for no benefit


FileHanding in java:
    -reading, writing, and manipulating(use) files

Why we should learn about file handling?
     1.) We dont store sensitive data inside the code, it might get exposed when we push the code to Github
     2.) HardCoding the data or credentials in code is a very bad practice because for any reason if you have
     to change the credentials or that data you will have to change it everywhere while will take lot of time
     3.) When we have to perform Data Driven Testing, we use alot of data to perform this type of testing , it is not
     feasible(possible to do easily or conveniently) to put all of that data in code

Steps to Read from any file in java:
     1.) First we need the location(path)
     2.) Use a class to navigate to that location(for example FileInputStream)
     3.) Use a special class that helps us read/write data to that special tyoe of file. for example::
     for .properties file we use Properties , and for excel we use XSSFWorkbook


Important concepts for your coding tests:
if else conditions
loops
arrays
String class methods
ArrayList
Maps

important concepts for verbal interviews:
OOPs
for Frameworks:
1) how Classes work for example how to create a class how to declare instance varibales how to use them inside
methods
2) Go through all the concepts of methods
3) types of varibales like instance static(you will be using heavily)
5) inheritance
6) ArrayList and maps
